<h2>high school journey</h2>
<p>After completing my standard 7 I applied at Khethisa High School and I was admitted.I started doing my form one in 2016.<br>I realised that one can be called a genuius in primary and be slow learner in hgh school I used to struggle very much in English even my teacher told me that I was not well equipped where I come from.<br>It was hurting when I remember I won an award of fluent young student in english poetry.My performance was so bad because I was position 20 in class and 58 in stream, when I was in form b I was performing quite well and I gained strength that you can still perform well.<br>I completed my junior certificate at the same school and I obtained first class again.</p>

<p>In 2019 I was doing my form D and that time I was an ancestor of school, I would arrive late at school, bully other students on top of that even refuse to do some task.<br>I remember one day when my matrons reported me to the principal for not doing what other students we doing which was to wake up at 4, my principal threatned me by expelling I cried and asked for forgiveness and luckily and forgave me and told me if ever I got to his office again I will be sent home.<br>From that day I started to behave like and a good student until I wrote my form E where I obtained 4grades and 4 passes.</p>
