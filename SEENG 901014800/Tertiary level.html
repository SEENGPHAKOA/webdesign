<h2>Maseru life</h2>
<p>Around July in the year 2021, i was admitted at Limkokwing university of creative technology Lesotho. Where I am currently doing my second year in bechelor of science in software engineering,under the fuculty of information and technology.I did well in my first year though it was tricky but i eventually made it to the second year. Iam very passionate about my school work,i consider it my top priority. I have always dreamed of being a software engineer, thats how important this course is to me hence i proect it at all costs.I always make sure that i perform on top of my class in every accessments we are give, thats the vow i made to my self when i enrolled here and i am always out to keep it,its this vow that keeps me going and going. I, like everybody else met and still meet some challenges here and there but with Gods help i always overcome them. In Maseru i am based at Tsoapo le BOlila, a small village not so far away from the town.  </p>
